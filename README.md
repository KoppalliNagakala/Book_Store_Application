# Book Store Application

This Book Store Application is a Java-based platform developed in Eclipse, designed for managing a collection of books. It allows users to register and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on book entries, making it easy to add new books, edit existing information, and delete books as needed.

## Key Features

1. **Register Books**: Users can add new books to the database, including details like bookname.edition and price.
2. **Edit Books**: Users can update the details of existing books, ensuring information is current and accurate.
3. **Delete Books**: Users can remove books from the database when they are no longer needed.
4. **View Book List**: The application displays a list of all books in the database, allowing users to see what is available.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Java (using Servlets for server-side logic and JDBC for database connectivity)
- **Frontend**: Dynamic HTML generated by Servlets (styled with Bootstrap for a responsive design)
- **Database**: MySQL

This application provides a straightforward interface for users to manage their book collections efficiently.
